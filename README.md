# Data Incubator Proposal 

The following is an i-python notebook detailing the steps of my data analysis.

I used Pandas to read and wrangle the data. 

I used Matplotlib to generate the plots and sci-kit learn to do some modeling. 

The file is divided into three main sections:

1. Reading Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Modeling Baseline 

The modeling is not formal since there are parameters to tune.
