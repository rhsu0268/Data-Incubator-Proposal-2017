# Data Incubator Proposal 

The following is an i-python notebook that consists of some code and preliminary analysis on the dataset that I found. 

I used Pandas to do a lot of data wrangling. 

I used Matplotlib to generate the plots and sci-kit learn to do some modeling. 

Note that there are several sections of the file:

1. Pulling in Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Modeling Baseline
